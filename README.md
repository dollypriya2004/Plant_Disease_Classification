The dataset includes images of healthy and diseased plant leaves, categorized into various classes such as Tomato, Potato, Apple, Grape, etc.

Model & Weights
Model: AlexNet

Pretrained Weights: Model and Best Weights

AlexNet is a convolutional neural network known for its performance on image classification tasks. Here, it is fine-tuned on plant leaf images for accurate disease prediction.

Features
Image preprocessing using standard techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Transfer learning using pretrained AlexNet.

Training, validation, and testing on real plant leaf data.

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix.

Easy-to-use and modify for other plant datasets.

Results
Achieved high accuracy on both validation and test sets.

Well-generalized model for multiple plant disease types.
